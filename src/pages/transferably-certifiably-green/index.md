You get a token that proves the item you've bought is genuine, along with who it was made by, when it was made, etc. This should help resale value, and in the case you buy something early, there's a good chance that it'll be worth something some day.

For early buyers, this means that everyone is getting a piece of history.

For later buyers, if they choose their designers well, they still have that chance.

For any buyers, theirs provably grown product should hold their value better than non-grown alternatives. Not only are they provably genuine, but people will know when they were made, what materials they were made of, who they were made by - and they'll also know that buying the product is helping make the world more sustainable, even if only indirectly.

In fact, there's one last incentive for buyers of grown products -- both brand new and second hand. And this is arguably the biggest incentive.

By funding grown industries, you're injecting money into a system that you may eventually desire to use yourself. You're funding your own plan B. Because when you buy grown, you're funding a system designed to help individuals <em>like yourself</em> become independant growers. Not only are you building yourself a viable alternative; you're building your peers a viable alternative too. You're giving people the opportunity to say "no" to corporate life. And when enough of us do – when corporate leaders need to compete with not just a viable alternative but an attractive one – then maybe we'll wonder why we didn't take the problem into our own hands sooner.
