You've probably seen loyalty point systems before. For example, maybe you get 1 or 2 percentage of your debit card back as cashback.

What if instead of you paying a higher price and getting points back (as happens with credit cards), you paid a higher price and the sustainable *producer* got points -- which can only be spent on further sustainable products, whose producers receive more points in turn.

Each time you purchase a product, you'd be injecting money into a sustainable economy, where the money continues to flow around the system, encouraging production and consumption of sustainable products. What's more, to the extent that these products supplant consumption in the traditional economy, they'd lowering consumption of unsustainable products.

Just as plant matter is recycled over and over again, so can renewable money be spent over and over again.

The goal of the money is to increase renewable production, at the expense of traditional consumption; to keep the money in the renewable ecosystem. With this in mind, some portion of the renewable premium could also be directed towards investment in the real estate and capital goods necessary for production, in turn lent out to the producers, reducing again the amount of real  money they need, and keeping more money within the renewable ecosystem.

The more you raise the prices, the more investment made, the greater the production of renewable goods, the less money leaving the system, the faster it displaces traditional consumption.

So how high can we raise the prices? How high *should* we raise the prices?
