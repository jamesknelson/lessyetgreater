- plants are solar-powered machines that convert the air into fiber and resin
- animals are biological chemical reactors that turn plant feedstocks into more useful materials, at a cost in energy
- oil is the gravity-compressed form of plant-based energy from forever ago. it's hugely more energtic than plants and animals, allowing us to do more (and consume more) with the same land area
- but while plants and animals will naturally grow back on human timescales, once we've used the natural oil, it's gone; not to mention that many of our oil-based products get into the nooks and crannies of the environment and make it worse.
- where there's no plant or animal based substitute for a product, we can make carbon-neutral oil from plants and solar power. but the cost will be far higher than buried oil.

todo data: cost of synthetic oil vs buried oil

- this explains why we need to use less; the reason oil is so cheap right now is because we're not paying its real cost. eventually we'll run out, if not of oil, then of carbon budget. in which case we'll be forced to pay the real cost, if not in sythetic oil, then in environment destruction

- specifically, on average we need to use x-y times less. but this is the other catch - very few people are actually average.
- there's a good chance that if you're reading this English-language article, you're in fact already above the average
- all up, we need to consume x - y times less to fit within our budget. and that means raising the prices, to a first approximate, a corresponding amount

- there's a reason that many products marketed as sustainable are expensive; being sustainable is actually expensive. cheap and easy fossil fuels distorts the prices, making things appear cheaper than they are.
- this wouldn't be so bad if it meant paying a little more, but the fact is that due to wealth inequality and the profusion of extractive instead of productive jobs, many people are already struggling to support themselves on these distorted prices.
- sacrifice is important, and necessary. but starving to death won't fix anything; to produce the quantity of grown products that we need, we need you to be well fed.
- still, somebody has to buy your products for the fair price.
- so who can afford to pay x-y times extra?

todo: calculate how many people can afford to pay x-y times extra, give examples of the types of people receiving these salaries

- if even 1% of those who could afford to pay x-y times extra did, we'd be able to fund y hectares of land for the production of grown products per year.
- the question remains though, even if 1% can afford it, what's in it for them?
