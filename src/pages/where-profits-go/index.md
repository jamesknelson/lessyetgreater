data todo: what percentage of goods go to materials? I've heard for some consumer goods it can be close to 10%

So if you buy some consumer good using 100% plant-based materials, and it costs 150% of the standard price for the privilege, then there's a good chance you're paying *more* to labor and corporate ownership than if you had bought the non-renewable alternative.

And what do labor and corporate ownership do with that?

data todo: what percentage of the economy is built on plant-based materials

hypothesis: by purchasing expensive organic products, in some cases you're doing more harm to the economy, as the increased profit margins won't be spent as responsibly as the money in your hand.

of course, this isn't always the case, but how do you know?

let's give this a name and a number: the human factor: a number that you multiple by the cost of your purchase to add an unsustainable component to your sustainable materials, to take into account how the people that made your materials spends their compensation.

what is the human factor for domestic labor? how about for foreign labor? what is it for organic farmers? what is it for "organic" products sold by multinational companies?

when we live in a modern nation, it'll be a long time before we can get the human factor to zero - especially when taxes need to be paid in local fiat currency, and when we have no control over the production processese of many modern necessities such as computers and phones.

but if we can get the human factor low enough, at least amongst grown industries, it becomes viable to charge a fair price for these products, without hurting the environment

in fact, it becomes paramount to do so - because the higher price provides an incentive for people to make these products.

but won't enriching producers just increase the human factor again? how can create both high prices and a low human factor?
