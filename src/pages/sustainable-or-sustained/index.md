title: Sustained? Or just sustainable?

- to build a society with land as a birthright, we need to think about sustainability from the start
- you have a right to land, yes. but so does the next generation. and the one after that
- but at some point it'll pass on to the next generation, and the one after that
- you have a duty to take care of it, to hand it back in as good a condition as you found it.
- and that's why we need to consider sustainability

---

- sustainable, renewable, recyclable. many products are advertised with these words
- but what does it actually mean? look closely, nobody who sells these products claims that anything will actually be sustained, renewed, recycled
- what they're selling is not responsibility, but an option to responsibility. a way for guilty consumers to salve their conscience
- but how many consumers will actually exercise this option?

todo: data on what percentage of recyclable materials are actually recycled

- what happens to things that aren't recycled?
- obviously, the oil runs out
- for plastics, they pollute the oceans

- what does renewable and sustainable even mean? companies sell products composed of chemicals which have only been in use for years or decades. how can anybody claim this is sustainable? we don't have enough data.

- the harsh reality is that just the option of being sustainable isn't enough. society needs a structure that is actually sustained by default
