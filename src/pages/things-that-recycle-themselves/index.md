title: Things that recycle themselves

- given the option, many people will not choose to recycle
- for plastics in particular, this is a problem. without recycling, the plastics disappear into the environment in the form of pollution. not only do we not get them back, but we have to deal with the environment and health consequences for generations
- but not all materials have this problem
- in fact, some materials recycle themselves by defaut. the owner would have to put in effort to *keep* them from being recycled

- you may be surprised to find that for most of human history, we actually used these materials
- many daily objects even now are composed to some level of these materials. while historically, the vast majority of our clothing and household goods were 100% organic and recycled
- have you guessed what the materials are yet?

- plants and animals

- our houses and furniture are often made of plants. pottery is made of soil, which comes from plants. clothing has historically been made from plant and animal fibers, maybe with a little wax to keep the water out. our food is often still mostly plants.

- plants and animals decompose, because our planet is filled with microscopic bioligical solar-powered machines that break them down into the building blocks of future life.

- if we were to again build a society whose daily consumables were 100% plant and animal based, we'd find that we have much more abundance than when faced with the same constraints in the past. our technology and improved techniquies allow us to get much greater efficiency from the raw materials available to us
- but while the land is our birthright, our technology and materials are the product of individual and corporate ingenuity. that they have value is obvoius, but can this value be quantified?
