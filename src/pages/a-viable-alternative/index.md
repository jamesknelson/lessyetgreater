What's the goddamn point.

By the time you graduate college, you're already deep in debt. But say you avoided that trap, it's still not like you could just find some unused land, build a homestead, and grow what you need to feed your family. There are phone, electricty and medical bills to pay, and none of them are likely to accept kale and potatoes. So day in, day out, you do what your boss tells you, she does what her boss asks her, and all in an effort to ~~grow shareholder value~~ *make the rich richer*.

TODO Visualization: x% of the wealth - including shares and real estate - belongs to y% of the population. Given that profit goes to the owners, the fruit of the vast majority of our collective labor is captured by the wealthy. Or, more bluntly, we're working ourselves to death, just to make the rich richer.

They say there's a mental health epidemic. *Of course* there's a mental health epidemic. At some level, we're all aware of the situation we're in. We all realize that we're working bullshit jobs to make the rich richer, that we're robbed of the fruits of our labor, yet we're too tired to do anything about it. While they celebrate our record "productivity", we worry how to pay the rent.

Visualization: % of the GDP going to rent and interest payments over time. 20% of our labor goes to just paying the rich for the privilege to exist. If we're so much more productive, why has the rent increased by an order of magnitude?

But what if the rent was free – literally? 


## Universal basic land

What if every human life received their own share of the earth's land, free to use however they deem fit. Free to farm, or free to lend to someone who can farm better. Free to homestead, or free to build a solar farm with output sold to the highest bidder.

You might think this sounds ridiculous or outright wrong. But consider what the rich did to deserve *their* land. They were born into it; it was their birthright. Why isn't it ours? Why is it that land – something that existed long before us and will exist long after us – can be bought and owned, indefinitely? How is it that a system can allow one child to charge another for the soil they were born onto, and then tell us that we should accept this, that this is somehow fair?

But say you receive your land tomorrow – all 5,000 square meters of it. What will it produce? Is it enough? How do you turn a football field sized plot of uncleared land into a comfortable modern life, with a home and car, good food and good company? And how does an individual – let alone an entire community – acquire and manage this land in the first place?


## Grown industries

- We help people who make things get higher prices for sustainable goods. Then we invest the difference back into the makers, by providing discounts for community-made produce and providing access discounted (and eventually free) land.
- As money flows into the community of makers, and more of the community's daily necessities can be purchased within the community, we'll build a base of capital to purchase new land, and to allow more people to join the community.
